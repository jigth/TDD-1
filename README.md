# TDD-1

Test Driven development project with multiple modules. The idea is to practice iteratively more complex things using TDD.

Initially only with arithmetic and simple functions and after that include Express, TypeScript and other dependencies to make a full fledged project using TDD methodology.

As of today (June 1 of 2024) I will only apply the DRY principle in the refactor step, the architecture I'll use may be a middle point between MVC and monular monolith, but it may evolve to Hexagonal Architecture with vertical slicing eventually.

Initially Unit tests will be prioritized but eventually Integration and E2E tests may be added.
